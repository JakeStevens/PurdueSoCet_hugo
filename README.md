# PurdueSoCet_hugo
Hugo source for website

For a reference on getting started with hugo, see the following link:
https://gohugo.io/overview/quickstart/

You should test your changes by running the following command:
hugo server

Before working on the hugo site, be sure you have a forked version of:
https://github.com/PurdueSoCet/purduesocet.github.io

If you are happy with your changes, you should run the deploy.sh script with the following usage:
./deploy.sh <path to your forked repository>

This script will build hugo into your forked directory, commit changes, and push to your master branch.

Once the script is complete, navigate to the github repository and initiate a pull request.
